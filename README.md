# movie-watchlist

This application acts as a search engine tool for users to search for reccomended movies. Two sets of APIs will provide the database of the movies




# Group Project - Movie Watchlist

This application is built using HTML, CSS, and Materialize and made interactive through JavaScript. It communicates with two public APIs to access movie data and gets selectively saved to local storage based on user input. Poster images, titles, director, and running time are provided by the Open Movie Database(OMDB) and trailer are provided by the Internet Movie Database(IMDb).

## User Story

As a user, I can browse/search movie by title, view posters images, read a synopsis and play a trailer. Based on my findings, I will be able to "like" movies by clicking an icon and add titles to a watchlist by clicking "add to watchlist". In order to "like" and "add", I will need to create a login/password.
