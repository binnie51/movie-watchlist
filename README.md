# Group Project - Movie Watchlist

This application is built using HTML, CSS, and Materialize and made interactive through JavaScript. It communicates with two public APIs to access movie data that will get selectively saved to local storage based on user input. Poster images, titles, directors, ratings, and running time are provided by the Open Movie Database(OMDB) and trailers are provided by the Internet Movie Database(IMDb).

## User Story

As a user, I can browse/search movie by title, view posters images, read a synopsis and play a trailer. Based on my findings, I will be able to add titles to a watchlist by clicking "add to watchlist". I can view my selections by clicking on "my watchlist".

## Acceptance Criteria
